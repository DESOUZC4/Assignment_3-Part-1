# Assignment_3-Part-1 and 2
Unit Code: SLE 712
Unit name: Bioinformatics and Molecular Biology Techniques 

## Aim of the Assignment
This assignment consist of two parts:
Part 1: The aim of Part 1 is to import the files from the databases and perform data wrangling, mathematical operations and create a histogram and box plots and saving these into Github.

Part 2: The aim of Part 2 demostrates various functions on how to test the limits of BLAST. The zipped files from the database were downloaded and unzipped. The main aim of this part is to analyze the alloted sequence data and perform manipulations and mutations using the various functions of BLAST and intepret these results accordingly.

## Motivation
This assignment helped us explore on how R can be used in the field of Biotechnology and the importance of using BLAST and its functions in DNA sequencing.

## Contents 
Part 1: For questions 1-5, the file "gene_expression.tsv" is downloaded. Based on the data present in the file, the mean and histogram was plotted as stated in the questions. For questions 6-10, the file "growth_data.csv" is downloaded. This file consists of the Tree circumference in the Northeast and Southwest regions at the control and he treatment site respectively. Based on this data. the mean and box plot was plotted as well as t.test and wilcox functions were used to estimate the p-value and the 2 sites over a period of 10 years.

Part 2: A zipped file consisting an whole set of E.coli gene has been provided. Based on the question 1, this file is unzipped and a blast database is created. Another file "sample fasta" was provided from which we have to take our allocated sequence and perform the manipulations and mutations as stated in the questions 2-6.

## Installation 
The R code was tested on R studio version 1.2.1335 and R version 3.6.3 (2020-02-29)
